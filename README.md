# Java Robot Controller

This Java application provides a GUI to control a robot through REST API calls. It has two main components: a login screen to authenticate users and a control panel to send movement commands to a robot.

## Features

- **Login Page**: Authenticates users with a username and password.
- **Robot Control Panel**: Provides arrow buttons to control the robot's movement (forward, backward, left, right), as well as start and stop buttons.
- **REST API Communication**: Sends GET requests to a specified server to control the robot based on button actions.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
- **Network Access**: The application requires network access to communicate with the REST API server.
